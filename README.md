Dementia Classification Based on Linguistic Analysis

- Project Overview
  
Our goal is to classify *if a patient has dementia /Alzheimers based on linguistic data from the DementiaBank dataset*. The label is a binary value indicating if the patient has dementia (1) or not (0). The predictor is the transcripts with audio data containing sentences from patients with or without dementia.

- Motivation & Novelty
  
Dementia is a debilitating neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve a patient's quality of life, but it can be challenging to identify dementia in its early stages. Machine learning models can help to classify individuals with dementia based on language use patterns, which can serve as an early diagnostic tool.

Healthcare professionals, researchers, and caregivers who work with individuals with dementia would find such models useful. Implementing these models could improve the quality of care and treatment for individuals with dementia while also supporting research into the underlying mechanisms of the disease.
